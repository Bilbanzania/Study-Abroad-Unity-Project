# Unity Project: Made in Tokyo üáØüáµ

### [ Live WebGL Demo ü•è](https://bilbanzania.github.io/Study-Abroad-Unity-Project_WebGL/)

A 3D game/experience developed using the Unity Engine. This project was created as part of a study abroad program at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, and serves as a key portfolio piece connecting game development principles with full-stack web development skills.

### The Purpose

This project was developed to explore and demonstrate a range of skills in game design and C# programming. It is now being presented as a portfolio piece to showcase:

* **Game Development Fundamentals:** Proficiency in using the Unity Engine, including scene creation, asset management, and C# scripting for game logic and interactivity.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Skills:** Applying software development principles learned in a full-stack web development curriculum to a real-time 3D application.
* **Adaptability and Global Perspective:** Experience gained from studying and developing a project in an international environment at Waseda University.
* **Web Integration:** The project is built and deployed using WebGL, making it accessible and playable directly in a web browser, demonstrating the ability to bridge the gap between standalone applications and web platforms.

### Technologies Used

* Unity Engine
* C#
* **Deployment:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (via Unity WebGL build)
